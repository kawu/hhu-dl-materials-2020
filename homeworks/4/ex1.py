    Arguments:
    * alpha_size: alphtabet size (number of different characters)
    * emb_size: size of vector representations assigned to the different characters
    * class_num: number of output classes (languages)

    Output: A neural model which transforms a tensor vector with
    input character indices, such as `tensor([0, 1, 2, 1])`, to
    a score vector, such as `tensor([0.6861, -0.7673,  1.2969])`. 
    
    Examples:

    # Create a language prediction model for 10 distinct characters
    # and 5 distinct languages
    >>> alpha_size = 10
    >>> emb_size = 5
    >>> class_num = 5
    >>> model = create_model(alpha_size, emb_size, class_num)

    # The model should be a nn.Module
    >>> isinstance(model, nn.Module)
    True

    # The size of the output score vector should be equal to `class_num`.
    >>> len(model(torch.tensor([0, 1, 2]))) == class_num
    True
